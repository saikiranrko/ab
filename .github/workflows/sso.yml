name: Echo Input Example
description: |
  A simple composite GitHub Action that prints a user-defined message.

  This action is designed to demonstrate how multi-line descriptions work for inputs.
  It can be reused in various workflows where basic message logging is required.

inputs:
  message:
    description: |
      ðŸ“Œ **Message to print**

      This is a required input. You should provide a string message that you want
      to display in the workflow logs.

      Multi-line descriptions like this help make inputs more readable in documentation or in GitHub Marketplace.

    required: true
    default: "Default message from action"

runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - name: Echo the input message
      run: echo "ðŸš€ Message from input: ${{ inputs.message }}"
